AE 中的多帧渲染
################################################################################

In order to take advantage of modern hardware with more CPU cores and threads, AE (currently only in Beta builds) now supports Multi-Frame rendering. Multi-Frame rendering allows multiple frames to be rendered concurrently thereby speeding up rendering and export of AE compositions.

Third-party effects can also take advantage of this feature through AE Plugin SDK by utilizing this PF_OutFlag::

  PF_OutFlag2_SUPPORTS_THREADED_RENDERING

This flag indicates the effect supports rendering on multiple threads at the same time. Single or multiple applications of this effect on a layer can be called to render at the same time on multiple threads.

.. note::
  **This flag should only be set on effects that have been tested to be thread-safe with multi-frame rendering enabled in AE. Please see** :ref:`ts-effect` **section below.**

If an effect is not explicitly marked as thread-safe, each render thread will wait until it can safely execute the effect code, effectively forcing rendering back to a single frame at a time​.

UI selectors are still sent on the main thread, however ``PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETUP``, ``PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_RESETUP``, ``PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETDOWN``, ``PF_Cmd_SMART_PRE_RENDER``, ``PF_Cmd_RENDER`` and ``PF_Cmd_SMART_RENDER`` may be sent on multiple threads at the same time as the UI selectors are being handled so all of these selectors must be thread safe.

``PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP`` and ``PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETDOWN`` selectors will only be sent on the main thread and will not be sent at the same time as any other selectors.

----

Some Temporary Implementation Details​
================================================================================
1. **There is still thread unsafe code in AE so we have enabled mutexes to force all thread unsafe code to run in single-thread mode**

  * The mutexes are to make sure rendering is safe and correct, however it has a large impact on performance. Multi-frame rendering is currently slower than single-frame rendering due to this​
  * Mutexes will be removed as AE’s render code is reviewed and made thread-safe

2. **The UI of AE does not yet know about the multi-frame rendering**

  * You can use a debug monitor or the AE log file to monitor the state of previews and export at this time. Please See :ref:`monitor-mfr`

3. **On preview and export, a fixed number of render threads will be created for the entire render**

  * The current implementation uses the number of logical CPU cores to determine the concurrent frames to render, ignoring comp complexity and system resource utilization​
  * The final implementation will monitor system utilization and dynamically adjust based on the comp being rendered​

4. **After Effects currently duplicates data structures for each render thread**

  * This can be time consuming when creating render threads which impacts performance
  * The shipping implementation will reduce this duplication overhead

----

.. _sequence-data:

Sequence Data in Multi-Frame rendering
================================================================================
Multi-Frame rendering requires that After Effects marshal ``sequence_data`` to the render threads. In order to make this efficient for effects with ``sequence_data`` that require flattening with the ``PF_OutFlag_SEQUENCE_DATA_NEEDS_FLATTENING`` flag, these effects must now also set the ``PF_OutFlag2_SUPPORTS_GET_FLATTENED_SEQUENCE_DATA flag``.

In addition, as multiple render calls may now happen concurrently, writing to ``seqeunce_data`` at render time will no longer be allowed. Results will be undefined if ``sequence_data`` is written at render time. In a future update to After Effects, ``sequence_data`` will be declared const when accessed at render time for effects that support multi-frame rendering.

In the coming months, After Effects will introduce a new interface for caching data at render time that would have previously been handled with ``sequence_data``. The checkout call on these caches will be able to detect if another thread is already creating the same cache entry and thus wait for the entry to be complete rather than duplicating the computing effort.


----

.. _ts-effect:

What does it mean for an effect to be thread-safe
================================================================================
**An effect is thread-safe when the implementation and shared data is guaranteed to be free of race conditions and is always in a correct state when accessed concurrently.**

To be more specific, the effect:
  1. Has no static or global variables OR, has static or global variables that are free of race conditions.
  2. Does not write to ``in_data->global_data`` at render time. Reading can be done. Write in ``GlobalSetup`` and ``GlobalSetdown`` only.
  3. Does not write to ``in_data->sequence_data`` at render time or during PF_Cmd_UPDATE_PARAMS_UI event. Reading can be done.
  
  (Solutions to 2 and 3 are currently being developed as mentioned in :ref:`sequence-data`)

How to locate the static and global variables in your effects
================================================================================
To help you locate the static and global variables in your effect, we've developed a **Static Analyzer tool** for you use. 
You can find the tool in this Git Repo: https://github.com/adobe/ae-plugin-thread-safety

If you develop on Mac:
  1. Clone/Download the Git Repo at the URL provided above
  2. Find the bash script ``check_symbols_for_thread_safety.sh`` in the **Mac** folder
  3. Navigate inside the package content of a plugin or effect and locate the binary files. (For example, the **Curves.plugin** has its binary file here: ``/Applications/Adobe After Effects [your AE version]/Plug-ins/Effects/Curves.plugin/Contents/MacOS/Curves``)
  4. To analyze the binary, run::

      check_symbols_for_thread_safety.sh [Binary location]
      For example, check_symbols_for_thread_safety.sh /Applications/Adobe After Effects [your AE version]/Plug-ins/Effects/Curves.plugin/Contents/MacOS/Curves)

  5. You will see output from the tool in this format::

      [symbol type]; [symbol name]

  6. ``[symbol type]`` is an one case-sensitive letter that indicates the type of the variable. You can find all the type information here: https://linux.die.net/man/1/nm
  7. Here is an example of the output::

      b; Deform::FindSilEdges()::new_kInfinite

    ``b`` shows this symbol is in the uninitialized data section, which indicates it might be a static variable.
    
    ``Deform::FindSilEdges()::new_kInfinite`` is the symbol name where ``Deform`` is name of the namespace that the variable is located at. 
    
    ``FindSilEdges()`` is the function name the variable is in.
    
    ``new_kInfinite`` is the actual variable name. Namespace and function names might not be shown based on where the variable is.

  8. Search for each symbol in your code, fix it (see :ref:`here <fix-static>` on how) and repeat for every binary file in your solution

|

If you develop on Windows:
  **1. Preparation**
    0. **In order to run this tool, you need a working installation of Visual Studio**
    1. Clone/Download the Git Repo at the URL provided above
    2. Find the ``register_msdia.cmd`` script in the **Win** folder
    3. Search for **"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS...."** from the **Start Menu**
    4. Right click -> Run as an Administrator
    5. In the terminal, ``cd`` to the directory where your ``register_msdia.cmd`` is located at
    6. Run ``.\register_msdia.cmd``
    7. This script will register the **DIA SDK** and some other required dependencies for you
    8. The Static Analyzer should be ready to work

  **2. Using the Windows Static Analyzer**
    1. Find the executable ``CheckThreadSafeSymbols.exe`` in the **Win** folder
    2. Compile your effect in **Debug** mode and find its **.pdb** file
    3. You should also find some **.obj** files in the same build directory if you haven't modified your project build settings
    4. You have **two options** on what to scan through: binaries or source files, using ``-objfile`` or ``-source`` flag.

      * **You can get the same symbols out of either option.** 
      * Use the ``-source`` option if you don’t know exactly what binaries your source code is ending up in, or if you’d like to keep track of thread safety on a per-source-file basis. 
      * Use the ``-objfile`` option if you want more fine-grained control over what parts of your project you’re scanning.

    5. To analyze the symbols in an object file, run::

        CheckThreadSafeSymbols.exe -objfile [absolute path to the binary you want analyzed] [absolute path to .pdb]

    6. To analyze the symbols in a source file, run::

        CheckThreadSafeSymbols.exe -source [absolute path to the source file you want analyzed] [absolute path to .pdb]

    7. Global variables aren't limited to the scope of one file or binary in pdbs, so you'll have to check over the list of all project globals without filtering. Use the -g output to get a list of all of them::
        
        CheckThreadSafeSymbols.exe -g [absolute path to .pdb]

    8. If you're unsure of what binaries your effect is outputting, the tool can also output a **(noisy)** list of binaries, along with the source files each pulls data from. Files you've changed are likely to be near the top. To see the list, run::

        CheckThreadSafeSymbols.exe -sf [absolute path to .pdb]

    9. Output symbols will take the form::

        [Symbol name], [Symbol type], [Datakind], ([Section type of data location], [Binary Address][Binary Address Offset])

    10. Here is an example of the output:

        .. code-block:: c++

          menuBuf, Type: char[0x1000], File Static, (static, [0008FCD0][0003:00001CD0])

      ``menuBuf`` is the actual variable name.

      ``Type: char[0x1000]`` shows what type of the variable it is. The data here is a ``char``.

      ``File Static`` shows what kind of that data it is. The data here is a **File-scoped static variable.** You can find all the data kinds and what they mean on this page https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-interface-access/datakind?view=vs-2019

      ``static`` shows that the data is in the static section of the memory.

      ``[0008FCD0][0003:00001CD0]`` shows the Binary Address and the Binary Address offset of the data.


    11. Search for each symbol in your code, fix it (see :ref:`here <fix-static>` on how) and repeat for every binary/source file in your solution

.. _fix-static:

What to do if you have static and globals in your effects
================================================================================
When you see a static or global variable, it would be the best to make it a local variable if possible. But what if that variable has to be static or global?

Here are some standard approaches for treating statics or globals:
  **1. Could the data be easily passed between functions instead without a change in behavior?**

    .. code-block:: c++

      // Example of a non Thread-Safe code

      static int should_just_be_local;

      void UseState() {
        DoComputation(should_just_be_local);
      }

      void SetAndUseState() {
        should_just_be_local = DoComputation();
        UseState();
      }

    **Either add it to a struct or expand function arguments to include it**

    .. code-block:: c++

      // We can fix the above code by passing the should_just_be_local variable through function arguments

      void UseState(int should_just_be_local) {
        DoComputation(should_just_be_local);
      }

      void SetAndUseState() {
        int should_just_be_local = DoComputation();
        UseState(should_just_be_local);
      }
    

  **2. Could the data be initialized before you execute your code (e.g. a lookup table, a const variable)?**

    .. code-block:: c++

      // Example of a non Thread-Safe code
      
      // Many places in the code need to read this table but won't be writing to it
      static int state_with_initializer[64]; 

      static bool state_was_initialized = false;

      void InitializeState() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
          state_with_initializer[i] = i * i;
        }
        state_was_initialized = true;
      }

      void Main() {
        if (!state_was_initialized) {
          InitializeState();
        }
        DoComputation(state_with_initializer);
      }

    **Make it** ``const`` **or replace it with a macro**

    .. code-block:: c++
      
      std::array<int, 64> InitializeState() {

        std::array<int, 64> temp;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
          temp[i] = i * i;
        }
        return temp;
      }

      // We can fix the above code by making this table a const and initialize it before using it
      static const std::array<int, 64> state_with_initializer = InitializeState();

      void Main() {
        DoComputation(state_with_initializer);
      }

  **3. Is the data initialized once at runtime based on data that doesn't change on subsequent renders?**

    .. code-block:: c++
      
      // Example of a non Thread-Safe code
      static int depends_on_unchanging_runtime_state;

      void UseState() {
        DoComputation(depends_on_unchanging_runtime_state);
      }

      void SetAndUseState() {
        depends_on_unchanging_runtime_state = DoComputationThatNeedsStateOnlyOnce();
        UseState();
      }

    **Double-check that this state isn't known before your code executes (case 2), but if you have to initialize at runtime use a const static local. (Note that thread-safe initialization of static local objects is part of the C++ spec)**

    .. code-block:: c++
      
      void UseState(int depends_on_unchanging_runtime_state) {
		    DoComputation(depends_on_unchanging_runtime_state);
	    }

      void SetAndUseState() {

        // We can fix the above code by making the variable a const static local
        static const int depends_on_unchanging_runtime_state = DoComputationThatNeedsStateOnlyOnce();

        UseState(depends_on_unchanging_runtime_state);
      }

  **4. The data has to stay static/global not being a const. But each render thread can have its own copy of the data.**

    .. code-block:: c++
      
      // This variable has to be static and not a const
      static int this_thread_needs_access;

      void SetState(int new_state) {
        this_thread_needs_access = new_state;
      }

      void UseState() {
        DoComputation(this_thread_needs_access);
      }
    
    **Just make the variable thread_local**

    .. code-block:: c++
      
      // Make this variable a thread_local variable
      thread_local static int this_thread_needs_access;

      void SetState(int new_state) {
        this_thread_needs_access = new_state;
      }

      void UseState() {
        DoComputation(this_thread_needs_access);
      }

  **5. The data has to stay static/global not being a const and each thread needs to read and write from the most up-to-date state. (rare)**

    .. code-block:: c++
      
      // This variable has to be static and not a const
      // It also needs to be shared across several threads
      static int every_thread_needs_latest_state;

      void SetState(int new_state) {
        every_thread_needs_latest_state = new_state;
      }

      void UseState() {
        DoComputation(every_thread_needs_latest_state);
      }

    **In this case, protect access with a mutex.**
    
    .. code-block:: c++
      
      // Add a mutex (lock)
      static std::mutex ex_lock;

      static int every_thread_needs_latest_state;

      void SetState(int new_state) {
        {
          // Protect the access with the mutex (lock)
          std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(ex_lock);
          every_thread_needs_latest_state = new_state;
        }
      }

      void UseState() {
        int state_capture;
        {
          // Protect the access with the mutex (lock)
          std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(ex_lock);
          state_capture = every_thread_needs_latest_state;
        }
        DoComputation(state_capture);
      }

.. note::
  **The above examples are the common cases we've seen in our effects. You can always come up other methods to treat your statics and globals that best suits your needs.**

----


Setting an Effect as Thread-safe
================================================================================
* Set the ``PF_OutFlag2_SUPPORTS_THREADED_RENDERING`` flag in ``GlobalSetup`` to tell After Effects that your effect is Thread-Safe and supports Multi-Frame Rendering. 

* Update the ``AE_Effect_Global_OutFlags_2`` magic number. Launch AE with your effect without changing the magic number for the first time, apply your effect and AE will give you the correct number to put in.

* If you are using the ``PF_OutFlag_SEQUENCE_DATA_NEEDS_FLATTENING`` flag, remember to also set the ``PF_OutFlag2_SUPPORTS_GET_FLATTENED_SEQUENCE_DATA`` flag.

----

How to test whether an effect is Thread-Safe
================================================================================

Once you have completed the above steps to make your effect Thread-Safe, you should now be ready to do some testing.

Enable Multi-Frame Rendering in After Effects Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. note::
  **Multi-frame rendering is currently only available in After Effects Beta builds which can be downloaded via the Creative Cloud Desktop application.**

  **At this time, access to multi-frame rendering is limited to and, recommended only for plugin developers to prepare their effects for multi-frame rendering support in After Effects.**

1. Download **After Effects Beta** from Creative Cloud Desktop
2. **Shift-Click** the **”What’s New”** beaker icon on the top right of the AE Window
3. Enter Unlock Code. (Unlock code is distributed privately at this time)

  .. figure::  images/Unlock.png
    :width:   500

4. Click Enable. After Effects will quit
5. Restart After Effects​
6. Multi-frame rendering will then be enabled


Configuring Concurrent Frame Count
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a simple comp, apply your effect and run preview once. This first run of Multi-Frame render will create some necessary preference entries
2. Go to AE Text preferences file::

    Location on Windows: %APPDATA%\Roaming\Adobe\After Effects (Beta)\17.1\Adobe After Effects 17.1 Prefs.txt​
    Location on Mac: ~/Library/Preferences/Adobe/After Effects (Beta)/17.1/Adobe After Effects 17.1 Prefs.txt​

3. Find this preference entry::

    ["Concurrent Frame Rendering"]​
    "Number of Concurrent Frame Renders" = "-1”​

4. Replace the number in quotes with the number of render threads you want to have.

  a. "-1" means use the default number render threads. By default, there will be 2-4 render threads created for a multi-frame render.
  b. You can put in any integer in the range from 1 to 99.

5. Restart AE after you change this preference for it to take effect

.. note::
  **This preference is temporary and will be removed when Multi-Frame Rendering is released to beta customers**


.. _monitor-mfr:

Monitoring Multi-Frame Renders​
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this time there are two ways to monitor multi-frame renders​.

Real-time Debug Monitor through​ Keyboard Shortcut:
  1. Delete your current keyboard shortcut file
  2. You can find the files here::

      Mac: ~/Library/Preferences/Adobe/After Effects (Beta)/17.1/aeks/After Effects Default.txt
      Windows: %APPDATA%\Roaming\Adobe\After Effects (Beta)\17.1\aeks\After Effects Default.txt

  3. Start AE and Press **Command+Shift+9** or **​Control+Shift+9**
  4. Find the AE.MultithreadedRenderer section

    .. figure::  images/debugmonitor.png
      :width:   400

AE Log File​:
  1. Enable logging (Help Menu -> Enable Logging)​
  2. Restart AE
  3. Search for **Multithreaded render report** in the log

    .. figure::  images/AE_Log.png
      :width:   400


Test your effect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have completed the above preparation steps, test your effect thoroughly. Right now we’d suggest simple comps that test the basic rendering and functionality of an effect.

1. Go through all your existing manual and automated testing plans.
2. Test all the effect parameters and make sure they are working properly.
3. Add in some of the AE effects that have already been made thread-safe as appropriate. See the :ref:`first-party` section.
4. Make sure there are no crashes, hang,s render differences or other unexpected changes when rendering with multi-frame rendering enabled.
